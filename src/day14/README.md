# Multi-bracket Validation.
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
Write a class called "MaxStack" that extends "Stack" and adds a new **max** method. The **max** method should return the highest value stored in the stack.

Make sure your **max** method works even when the stack has been updated (ie, a new maximum may have been pushed or the current maximum may have been popped).  Hint: these scenarios are good test cases!
