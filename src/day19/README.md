# Determine if two Binary Trees are identical
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
Create a new method on your **BinaryTree** class called **isIdentical** that accepts a reference to another **BinaryTree** and returns true if the two trees have an identical structure. You may assume each **BinaryTree** only stores data of type **int** and is not generic.

Trees are considered identical if nodes are in the same positions, and data values are identical. You should be able to traverse the two trees stepping left and right simultaneously, having the same data value along the way without any problems. If one tree ever has a node where the other tree does not or one node has data not matching the other tree then you know the trees are not identical.
